- Breadcrumb title links
- Broken tables: `wiki/Lua/Client/ClientStaticObject.html` and `wiki/Lua/Client/ClientEntity.html`
- Need a way to serve output directly
- Need a way to regenerate pages on edit, including everything downstream
- Run conversions in parallel, maybe... I suspect running in release is sufficient
